This is a little toy game engine for a MOO/MUD in C#.

Made because I got nostalgic for the weird old MUDs I used to play as a kid and thought it would be fun to try making one. This morphed into experimenting with implementing the actor pattern for concurrency (similar to Akka.NET et al), which has been pretty fun so far.

This is not anything serious as of yet.
